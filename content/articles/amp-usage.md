I've been using AMP for a while now and I've been enjoying it. It's a great tool for solving complex coding problems.

I am impressed by the way it can solve complex problems. I have had many moments where it one-shot solved the problem where other agents struggled. This is the reason I am so excited about it and I am looking forward to using it more. The only complaint I have is that it is is expensive but I guess it's worth it.

At the same time I have also had moments where it failed to solve the problem like any other agentic coding assistant. I guess it's partly because we tend to rely on it too much when it succeeds and when it fails we don't know what went wrong. This resonates with the tweet by Sentry boss, David Cramer:

The biggest problem with agentic coding and having these large sweeping changes is that it takes a different skill entirely as the human behind the keyboard running it. 
More of us are used to writing and editing code and not so much reading.

I like the approach by David Kurshid, author of X-State, where he advocates for a more human-centered approach to coding.

The legendary programmer and creator of Ruby on Rails, DHH shares the most phenomenal take on what AI takes away from programmers and how he approaches coding with AI:

That's it for now. Seems like the post deviated from the topic of AMP usage and got more into general agentic coding practices. But I think it's important to share my experience with AMP and how it has helped me in my coding journey. I look forward to sharing more about my journey with AMP and agentic coding in the future.
