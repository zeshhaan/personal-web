Everyone has their own way of approaching problems. For me, I prefer to start by visualizing the end result before diving into the work. This approach gives me both excitement and confidence, regardless of how complex the problem might be.

In my early days as a developer, I used to get overwhelmed by complex problems and would end up procrastinating. I spent countless hours in this paralyzed state, frantically trying different approaches to reach a solution quickly. This scattered approach led to numerous half-baked solutions and mounting frustration.

Now, whenever I encounter a problem, I take a different approach: I break it down into smaller, manageable chunks. This strategy helps me focus on one piece at a time, making the work more accountable and easier to document. As an added benefit, this methodical approach consistently yields more thoughtful, well-structured code.

The transformation from chaos to clarity didn't happen overnight, but this systematic approach has made problem-solving far more enjoyable and effective.
