Everybody have their own way of approaching a problem. For me, it starts with visualizing the end result before I start working on it. This gives me excitement and confidence regardless of the complexity of the problem.

In my initial days, I used to get overwhelmed by the complexity of the problem and would end up procrastinating. I spent countless hours in this stage trying different ways to get to the solution quickly. I would end up with a lot of half baked solutions and would get frustrated.

Instead now, each time I get to work on a problem, I try to break down it into smaller chunks. This helps me to focus on one thing at a time and makes ourselves accountable and easy to document. This also yields a well thoughtful code.

And in case if you are stuck, don't hesitate to ask for help. But always try to solve the problem ourselves before asking.

Additionally, don't get stuck on a problem for too long. If you are stuck, let the team know and move on to something else and come back to it later. This will give you a fresh perspective and you might find a solution. Its okay to not know everything. Nobody does. We are all learning. And that's the beauty of it.

Oh, and before you go, one more thing: Be open to failure. This is something I used to struggle with and still do. I used to think that I would be judged if I ask for help. But I was wrong. Asking for help is a sign of strength and not weakness. It shows that you are willing to learn and grow. It also shows that you are willing to help others.
