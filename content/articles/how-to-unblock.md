Everyone gets stuck at some point. It's okay to get stuck. But it's not okay to stay stuck. Here are some tips on what helped me to unblock myself when I am stuck.

First is first: If you are stuck, don't hesitate to ask for help. But always try to solve the problem ourselves before asking.

Don't get stuck on a problem for too long. If you are stuck, let the team know and move on to something else and come back to it later. This will give you a fresh perspective and you might find a solution. Its okay to not know everything. Nobody does. We are all learning. And that's the beauty of it.

Oh, and before you go, one more thing: Be open to failure. This is something I used to struggle with and still do. I used to think that I would be judged if I ask for help. But I was wrong. Asking for help is a sign of strength and not weakness. It shows that you are willing to learn and grow. It also shows that you are willing to help others. The only way to be truly confident in yourself is to become comfortable with what you lack.
