In my early career, before getting into software industry, i used to work in office. Although it went well for a while, It wasn't my taste. One of the reason i got into software industry is because i can embrace this remote culture. There are quite a few reasons why i like working remotely. I will try to list them down here.

### 1. Introvert.

Being introvert, It's hard to meet people face to face. I'm a very shy person and I feel comfortable talking to people online. I can express myself better when i'm not face to face with someone. I can think better and i can express myself better. I can be myself.

### 2. No commute.

I'm someone who likes to spend every bit of time being productive. I don't like to waste time. I don't even like to take a nap except during night or sick. Commuting comes with a lot of cost. I feel tired after commuting.

3. No office politics.
4. No distractions.
5. No dress code.
6. No fixed working hours.
7. No fixed location.
