I got to know Elixir when stumbling upon Stackoverflow Survey 2021. I was impressed by the metrics and the fact that it was the most loved programming language. I was curious to know more about it and started learning it. I started to follow #myElixirStatus in Twitter, and joined the folks at Slack, Discord and the official forum. I found the community very active and welcoming newbies. I briefly took part in dockyard's beta cohort lead by Brooklin Jazz last year but got quite busy with my full time job and other commitments. During those brief period of time, I took a lot of motivation and learning with me.

This write up is a brief introduction to Elixir and why I chose to invest my time in it. I got to ask this question a lot of times, and I thought it would be a good idea to write it down.
